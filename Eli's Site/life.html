                                I've always loved exploring. Whether it was the contents of a book or a ecology of a forest. I still wonder what exactly I want to do with my life. It seems like everyone else has a plan for their life but I still need to finalize my own. I know that I would like to work in the scientific field but I don't exactly know what.

                                During the summer before the start of my sophomore year, I went to Peru. I was amazed. The country was so beautiful and had diverse geographics. But my mind wasn't solely focused on the beauty of the country but also the hardships and history of the country. I met so many people with different backgrounds. I learned about the history of the natives and their traditions. I learned about the colonization in certain areas of Peru but also about the archeteture of the ruins. I was in love with the experience I was priviledged enough to have.

                                I am priviledged. Not to say that I didn't have my share of hardships, but probably not as much and anyone else. I was lucky enough to be born to a hardworking mother and a father who was better than some. I was born in the United States, which is lucky enough. I am fortunate to have education, good health, and stability. I don't have to deal with as much sexism and 'machismo' as my mother and father had to. I am lucky to have healthcare and safety. There's not really anything to complain about other than the misunderstanding of myself and others due to a lack of information.
