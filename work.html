                            I was involved in the painting of murals with ties to the Mexican-American Culture. During this weeklong experience, I got to work with Scarlett Baily, an amazing artist with so much happiness that it's contagious. Working with her was like a dream; she was so enthusiastic about her work and it truly showed. It opened this door that I had closed myself a long time ago when I was young. It was an amazing experience to relive my childhood of playing "Loteria" with my aunt and finding out that my mustache is badass when I learnerd that Frida Kahlo was as hairy as I was and watching Cantinflas' movies with my dad when I was younger. It was an experience that I had the pleasure of sharing with an amazingly talanted artist and my best friend, Moises.

                            In my sophomore year of highschool, I participated as a political forum moderator for the CSTCA political forum. It was a learning experience. Not only did I recieve the oppertunnity to asked meaningful questions to delegates themselves, I was able to contribute to the questions asked. I participated in an event that was able to inform so many voters at the time and help them access the canidates for the county and district elections.

                            I like to donate blood. I'm not really sure why, but it's always interesting to me. My mother doesn't really like that I like to donate blood. She used myths about donated blood to deter me at first, but I had already done my research and was ready to refute them. I can always make more blood, this way I can help people even if it's indirectly. I mind the needle, but I wouldn't stop donating because the needle stings a little.
